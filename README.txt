# README for Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! Below, you’ll find a collection of projects showcasing my work in data science, machine learning, and financial modeling. Each project focuses on a unique problem or concept, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, web development, and algorithm implementation. Here's a brief overview of my featured projects:

## 1. **SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Success Analysis**
   This project analyzes the historical data of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launches to predict the success of its landings. Using classification models and exploratory data analysis, I investigate the factors that influence landing outcomes.

## 2. **Stock Price Dashboard Web App**
   A Streamlit web app that visualizes stock market data in real-time. It integrates Yahoo Finance API to extract stock prices and presents interactive charts, including candlestick charts, moving averages, and return distributions, all made using Plotly and Seaborn.

## 3. **Hypothesis Testing in Python**
   This project demonstrates various hypothesis testing techniques in Python, including t-tests and ANOVA. The project serves as a foundational example for using statistical tests to derive meaningful conclusions from data.

## 4. **Brownian Motion Simulations in Python**
   A deep dive into simulating random movements of particles using the concept of Brownian motion. This project visualizes stochastic processes and showcases the simulation of different paths a stock price might follow over time.

## 5. **Stock Price Prediction Using the Black-Scholes Model**
   In this project, I implemented the Black-Scholes model to predict stock option prices. This project is deployed through GitHub, and it includes pricing calculations, implied volatility estimation, and option greeks analysis.

Feel free to explore the projects to see how I apply various tools and methodologies in data science and finance!
